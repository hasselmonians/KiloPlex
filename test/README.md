This folder contains [files](http://data.cortexlab.net/singlePhase3/data/) sent by N. Steinmetz,
which can be used for testing the KiloPlex protocol for RatCatcher.

The raw data is in `rawDataSample.bin` and the `master_file.m` is deconstructed
to form the files necessary for the RatCatcher pipeline.
